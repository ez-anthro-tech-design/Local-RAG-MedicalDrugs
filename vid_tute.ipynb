The starting dose in such patients should be reduced to one tenth (1110) of the usual dose. MAOI | dopexamine (6) Dopexamine is contraindicated in patients receiving MA01 MAOIhoradrenaline (7, 8) This interaction may produce a hypertensive crisis. However, noradrenaline is very rapidly taken up from circulation by adrenergic nerves and is inactivated by COMT enzyme, Therefore since monamine oxidase is probably little involved in this metabolism, the interaction is less likely than with other sympathomimetic amines which rely upon monoamine oxidase for their inactivation. Although noradrenaline is less likely to induce a hypertensive episode in patients receiving MA01 antidepressants than other sympathomimetic drugs, the risk is still present. Thus it would be wise to adhere to the general contraindication of all sympathomimetics in patients receiving such antidepressants. MAOI |  phenylpropanolamine reported with this interaction. (9-12) Hypertensive crises with fatal episodes have been Phenylpropanolamine is a common ingredient of many proprietary remedies designed to alleviate symptoms of the common cold, hay fever and rhinitis, etc. This combination is dangerous; phenylpropanolamine should not be given to patients being treated with a MA01 antidepressant or within 2 weeks of stopping such treatment. The UK government has (January 1984) proposed that all medicinal products containing phenylpropanolamine will be available only on prescription except where products are indicated for the relief of cough, colds and hay fever, with a recommended maximum daily dose of not more than 75 mg.

       "  'text': 'DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH LITHIUM SALTS 327 Combination Interaction There are theoretical reasons and some clinical data to indicate that serum lithium levels fall when cisplatin is given. This effect appears to be rapidly reversed but it may be important when high-dose cisplatin is repeated frequently. Lithium levels should be carefully monitored under such circumstances (43). Antipsychotic agentdlithium chlorpromazine (44-46) Since the antimanic effect of lithium carbonate may be delayed for 7-10 days after starting treatment, chlorpromazine has been given concurrently for earlier control of manic behaviour. Lithium has been reported to be excreted more rapidly during concomitant treatment with chlorpromazine (44). Concomitant administration of lithium carbonate and chlorpromazine in normal subjects reduced peak plasma chlorpromazine concentrations to 59.7% of levels with chlorpromazine alone. Area under the chlorpromazine concentration-time curve was 2.6% smaller when lithium was taken as well (45). This interaction may explain inadequate responses to therapeutic doses of chlorpromazine. It may also explain why there may be a sudden onset of chlorpromazine toxicity when lithium is withdrawn (46). Use this combination with caution. Haloperidol and other phenothiazines (47-64) There have been isolated reports of neurotoxicity of brain damage (delerium, seizures, encephalopathy, increased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms) in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with flupenthixol (47), fluphenazine (48), high doses of haloperidol (49-51) or thioridazine (52, 53). However, retrospective studies have failed to detect such adverse interactions in patients receiving lithium and neuroleptics concomitantly (54, 55). It has been suggested (56) that neurotoxicity induced by lithium and neuroleptics is a rare entity, about 40 cases being reported in the literature. There is controversy whether the combination produces any greater risk than either agent alone and there is controversy over whether the neurotoxicity is a distinct diagnostic entity'}]"

Vitamin and mineral supplements are a common combination and are readily obtained as non-prescription medicines. The possibility of their interaction with prescribed medicines may not be appreciated. It is the mineral component of the combination product, as well as the mineral content of antacids and some laxatives that is responsible for the majority of these interactions. It should not be forgotten that many foods are rich in minerals and these may also enter into interactions (e.g. with tetracyclines and dairy products), in addition branded breakfast cereals have added minerals and vitamins. A list showing the mineral content of common food- stuffs is given at the end of this chapter (Table 6), and in this respect it must be remembered that the portion of food normally consumed should be taken into account as well as its mineral content.

The mechanism involved was thought to be ciprofloxacin’s induction of the P450 oxidative enzymes responsible for phenytoin’s metabolism. Nightly administration of dichloralphenazone significantly increased the clearance of phenytoin in an epileptic patient due to induced microsomal enzyme activity with loss of epileptic control. The interaction has been confirmed in healthy subjects. Phenobarbitone induces liver microsomal enzymes and thus increases the metabolism of phenytoin.',\n",

This prediction has not come about, although the problem of drug interactions is still with us and the spectrum is widening as new drugs are introduced. Indeed it could be said that the nature of the problem has also widened for in the intervening years drug interactions have come to embrace interactions with food and with herbal medicines as well as the more numerous and better recognized drug-drug interactions. There is little doubt that drug-drug interactions can often be serious, even life- threatening. They can also be very expensive, and evidence from the Medical Defence Unions’ Reports of over 10 years ago reveals that one case which settled for &44 000 was due to phenylbutazone-induced potentiation of warfarin which was followed by an intraspinal haemorrhage resulting in an incomplete tetraplegia at the level of C7.',\n",

Knowledge of the ‘state of the art’ has much advanced since the 1980s and what were then novel and scientifically interesting interactions are now established and well-recorded interactions in standard books of reference. Knowledge has advanced but there has been little progress in the way in which it is generated.
